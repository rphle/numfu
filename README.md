# NumFu Programming Language

**NumFu** is a pure, interpreted, functional programming language designed for readable & expressive code, extensibility, and ease of learning for beginners.

NumFu's simple syntax and semantics make it well-suited for educational applications, such as courses in functional programming and general programming introductions. At the same time, as its name suggests, NumFu is also ideal for exploring mathematical ideas and sketching algorithms, thanks to its native support for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

## Features

- **Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic** - Reliable mathematical computing powered by Python's mpmath
- **First-Class Functions** - Automatic currying, partial application, and function composition
- **Expressive Syntax** - Infix operators, spread/rest operators, and lots of syntactic sugar
- **Tail Call Optimization** for efficient recursive algorithms without stack overflow
- **Interactive Development** - Friendly REPL and helpful error messages
- **Minimal Complexity** - Only four core types: `Number`, `Boolean`, `List`, and `String`
- **Python Integration** - Large & reliable standard library through NumFu's Python runtime
- **Extensible** - NumFu is written entirely in Python with the goal of being extensible and easy to understand.

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### From PyPI
```bash
pip install numfu-lang
```

#### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rphle/numfu
cd numfu
make install
```

### Hello NumFu!

Create `hello.nfu`:
```numfu
import sqrt from "math"

// Mathematical computing with arbitrary precision
let golden = {depth ->
  let recur =
    {d -> if d <= 0 then 1 else 1 + 1 / recur(d - 1)}
  in recur(depth)
} in golden(10) // ≈ 1.618

// Function composition & piping
let add1 = {x -> x + 1},
    double = {x -> x * 2}
in 5 |> (add1 >> double) // 12

// Partial Application
{a, b, c -> a+b+c}(_, 5, _)
// {a,c -> a+5+c}

// Assertions
sqrt(49) ---> $ == 7

// Built-in testing with assertions
let square = {x -> x * x} in
  square(7) ---> $ == 49  // ✓ passes
```

Run it:
```bash
numfu hello.nfu
```

### Interactive REPL

```bash
numfu repl
```

```
NumFu REPL. Type 'exit' or press Ctrl+D to exit.
>>> 2 + 3 * 4
14
>>> let square = {x -> x * x} in square(7)
49
>>> import max from "math"
>>> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] |> filter(_, {x -> x%2 == 0}) |> max
6
```

## 📖 Documentation

- **[Language Guide](https://rphle.github.io/numfu/docs/)** - Complete language tutorial & reference
- **[Built-ins Reference](https://rphle.github.io/numfu/docs/reference/builtins)** - All built-in functions and operators
- **[CLI Reference](https://rphle.github.io/numfu/docs/reference/cli)** - Command-line interface guide

> [!NOTE]
> As a language interpreted in Python, which is itself an interpreted language, NumFu is not especially fast. Therefore, it is not recommended for performance-critical applications or large-scale projects. However, NumFu has not yet been thoroughly optimized so you can expect some performance improvements in the future.

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

- Python ≥ 3.10

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rphle/numfu
cd numfu
make dev
```
The `make dev` command also installs Pyright and Ruff via Pip. To format code and check types, it is strongly recommended to run both `ruff check --fix` and `pyright` before committing.

## Building NumFu

```
make build
```

NumFu contains built-ins written in NumFu itself (src/numfu/stdlib/builtins.nfu).
`make build` first installs NumFu without the built-ins, then parses and serializes the file, and finally performs a full editable install. The script also builds NumFu and creates wheels.

### Building Documentation

```bash
cd docusaurus && npm i && cd .. # make sure to install dependencies

make serve  # local preview
make docs   # build to 'docs-build'
```

```

## Testing

NumFu is tested with over 300 tests covering core features, edge cases, and real-world examples — including most snippets from the documentation. Tests are grouped by category and include handwritten cases as well as tests generated by LLMs (mostly Claude Sonnet 4).

Every test is self-validating using assertions and fails with an error if the output isn’t exactly as expected.

To run all tests from the `tests` folder:

```bash
make test
```
